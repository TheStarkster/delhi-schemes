                <p className="contrast-bg contrast-text mt-4 text-lg">
                    The socioeconomic conditions of a family play a significant role in rendering children more susceptible to adversity. Increasing awareness of government social security initiatives and resources as well as linking these households with various schemes can mitigate the vulnerability of the entire family unit. Consequently, this endeavour of empowering such households with awareness of their rights and entitlements as well as assisting/collaborating with stakeholders in connecting them to various schemes can make a substantial contribution to enhancing child welfare and safety in Delhi.
